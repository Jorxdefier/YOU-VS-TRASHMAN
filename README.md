Quick note, just download a wav file of Megalovania and save it in the same spot as all the other files, and the main game itself. If you want to add other music it's fine, just make sure to save it as "StrandMegalovania.wav" when you do or the game will not work. I couldn't upload it here as the sound file was way too big for github
